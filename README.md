# 📄 Speech to Text for Transcription Services


## 🔍 Overview

The notebook walks through the steps of:

1. Loading and preparing audio files.
2. Preprocessing the audio (resampling, normalization).
3. Using a pretrained speech recognition model to transcribe the audio.
4. Displaying or saving the final transcribed text.

## 🚀 Features

* Utilizes **transformers** or other modern speech-to-text libraries (e.g., `torchaudio`, `whisper`, `SpeechRecognition`).
* Can handle `.wav` or similar audio formats.
* End-to-end transcription with minimal setup.
* Easily extendable for batch processing or integration with user interfaces.

## 🛠️ Dependencies

The notebook typically requires the following Python libraries (make sure to install them if they’re not already):

```bash
pip install torch torchaudio transformers librosa soundfile
```

Other possible dependencies include:

* `SpeechRecognition`
* `pydub`
* `openai-whisper` (if using Whisper)

## 📁 Structure

Typical sections in the notebook:

* **Setup**: Install and import required libraries.
* **Data Loading**: Load audio files from disk.
* **Preprocessing**: Normalize and format audio.
* **Model Inference**: Use a pretrained ASR model to transcribe.
* **Output**: Display or save the transcription results.

## 📌 Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Open it in JupyterLab or Google Colab.
2. Ensure required libraries are installed.
3. Upload or link your audio files.
4. Run all cells and view transcriptions in the output.

## 📈 Future Improvements

* Add speaker diarization (who said what).
* Add support for noisy audio.
* Integrate with a web UI or REST API for live transcription.
* Add translation for multilingual audio.
